Student Guide is an opinionated guide for students who are and will be studying at Riga Technical University.

When I first arrived in Latvia, it was a bit difficult to get used to the new environment, especially when there was no on to guide me. I hope this guide will help you to get started with your studies at RTU, starting from application process to graduation.

Well, since I haven't graduated yet, I can provide with what I know so far. I will keep updating this guide as I learn more.
