Hey, there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Doston, the author of this blog. I'm a second-year Computer Science student at Riga Technical University in Riga, Latvia. I love learning new things and sharing them with others.

It's been over a year since I started my journey with coding. Having no idea about programming, my chosen field enlightened me with a new world of possibilities. Now, I'm a frontend developer, designing and building web apps in my free time.

Aside from programming, I enjoy reading science fiction books and [blogging](https://dev.to/dostonnabotov).
