Students find out about RTU in different ways. Some are recommended by friends, while others come accross by chance. As for me, I found out about RTU through an essay contest. I was in my final year of high school, and was looking for ways to get into a university. Then on January 10, 2021, I came across an essay contest, which I didn't know how it would completely transform my life. Despite not winning the contest, I was invited to an interview, and was accepted to RTU. Afterwards, it was a long process of preparing documents and applying for a visa. I was finally able to come to Latvia a year later on January 31, 2022. Here is how I got through.

When applying to RTU, you will need to submit the following documents:

- [Application form](https://www.rtu.lv/en/university/application-form)
- IELTS (minimum 5.5) or TOEFL (minimum 61)
- Transcript of records from high school

> Note: Make sure to focus on your grades in the last two years of high school, especially in Physics and Mathematics. Regardless of your chosen field, you will need to take these two subjects in your first year of study. And, RTU heavily focuses on these two subjects.
